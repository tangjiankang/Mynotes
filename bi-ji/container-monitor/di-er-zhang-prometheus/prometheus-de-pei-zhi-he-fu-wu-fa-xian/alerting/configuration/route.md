# route

**route** 路由块定义路由树中的节点及其子节点。如果未设置，则其可选配置参数将从其父节点继承。

每个警报都会在配置的顶级路由中进入路由树，该路由必须匹配所有警报（即没有任何已配置的匹配器）。然后它遍历子节点。如果`continue`设置为false，则在第一个匹配的子项后停止。如果`continue`在匹配节点上为true，则警报将继续与后续兄弟节点匹配。如果警报与节点的任何子节点都不匹配（没有匹配的子节点，或者不存在），则根据当前节点的配置参数处理警报。

route:
[ receiver: <string> ] 
# 默认的receiver，如果某条告警没有被一个route匹配，则发送给默认的接收器

# The labels by which incoming alerts are grouped together. For example,
# multiple alerts coming in for cluster=A and alertname=LatencyHigh would
# be batched into a single group.
# 这里的标签列表是接受到告警信息后的重新分组标签,
# To aggregate by all possible labels use the special value '...' as the sole label name, for example:
# group_by: ['...'] 
# This effectively disables aggregation entirely, passing through all 
# alerts as-is. This is unlikely to be what you want, unless you have 
# a very low alert volume or your upstream notification system performs 
# its own grouping.
[ group_by: '[' <labelname>, ... ']' ]

# Whether an alert should continue matching subsequent sibling nodes.
# 警报是否应继续匹配后续兄弟节点
[ continue: <boolean> | default = false ]

# A set of equality matchers an alert has to fulfill to match the node.
# 一组平等匹配警报必须满足以匹配节点
match:
  [ <labelname>: <labelvalue>, ... ]

# A set of regex-matchers an alert has to fulfill to match the node.
# 一组正则表达式匹配器必须满足警报以匹配节点
match_re:
  [ <labelname>: <regex>, ... ]

# How long to initially wait to send a notification for a group
# of alerts. Allows to wait for an inhibiting alert to arrive or collect
# more initial alerts for the same group. (Usually ~0s to few minutes.)
# 最初等待为一组警报发送通知的时间。 允许等待禁止警报到达或收集同一组的更多初始警报
# 在一个新的告警分组被创建后，等待至少group_wait时间来初始化通知，这种方式可以确保有足够的时间为同一分组获取多条告警，然后一起触发这条警报。
[ group_wait: <duration> | default = 30s ]

# How long to wait before sending a notification about new alerts that
# are added to a group of alerts for which an initial notification has
# already been sent. (Usually ~5m or more.)
# 在第一条警报信息发送后，等待group_interval时间来发送新的一组警报信息。
[ group_interval: <duration> | default = 5m ]

# How long to wait before sending a notification again if it has already
# been sent successfully for an alert. (Usually ~3h or more).
# 如果某条警报信息已经发送成功，则等待repeat_interval时间重新发送它们。
[ repeat_interval: <duration> | default = 4h ]

# Zero or more child routes.
# 上面的所有属性都由所有子路由继承，并且可以在每个子路由上覆盖。
routes:
  [ - <route> ... ]
